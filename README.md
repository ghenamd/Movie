# Movie

### Project Overview
In this project, you’ll build an app to allow users to discover the most popular movies playing. 

#### Your app will:

* Present the user with a grid arrangement of movie posters upon launch.
* Allow your user to change sort order via a setting:
* The sort order can be by most popular or by highest-rated
* Allow the user to tap on a movie poster and transition to a details screen with additional information such as:
original title
movie poster image thumbnail
* A plot synopsis (called overview in the api)
user rating (called vote_average in the api)
release date
* Allow users to view and play trailers ( either in the youtube app or a web browser).
* Allow users to read reviews of a selected movie.
* Allow users to mark a movie as a favorite in the details view by tapping a button(star).
* You'll create a database to store the names and ids of the user's favorite movies (and optionally, the rest of the information needed to display their favorites collection while offline).
* You’ll modify the existing sorting criteria for the main view to include an additional pivot to show their favorites collection.

#### Why this Project?
Learn how to build clean and compelling user interfaces (UIs), fetch data from network services, and optimize the experience for various mobile devices. You will hone these fundamental skills in this project.

By building this app, you will demonstrate your understanding of the foundational elements of programming for Android. Your app will communicate with the Internet and provide a responsive and delightful user experience.

#### What Will I Learn ?
You will fetch data from the Internet with theMovieDB API.
You will use adapters and custom list layouts to populate list views.
You will incorporate libraries to simplify the amount of code you need to write
